Trust calibration, which aims to align users' trust with the actual capabilities of AI systems, has emerged as a critical research area. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on trust calibration for AI systems. We first introduce the concept of trust calibration and its importance in human-AI interaction. Then, we categorize the existing methods for trust calibration into three main categories: (1) methods that focus on improving the transparency and interpretability of AI systems; (2) methods that focus on providing feedback and explanations to users; and (3) methods that focus on adapting the AI system's behavior to users' trust levels. We also discuss the challenges and future directions in this field. This survey aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in developing and deploying trustworthy AI systems.\",\n",

These studies often involve exposing users to AI systems with varying levels of transparency, explanations, and feedback mechanisms, and then measuring their trust levels.\\n*   **Explainable AI (XAI):**  Several papers focus on the role of XAI in trust calibration. They explore different XAI techniques (feature importance, counterfactual explanations, rule-based explanations) to see how they help users understand AI systems and calibrate their trust.\\n*   **Uncertainty Visualization:**  Some studies investigate how visualizing the uncertainty of AI predictions impacts user trust. They compare different visualization methods (error bars, confidence intervals, probability distributions).\\n*   **Feedback Mechanisms:**  The impact of different types of user feedback (explicit, implicit, interactive) on trust calibration is also a focus of research.\\n*   **Frameworks for Trust Calibration:** Some papers propose frameworks that outline the key stages involved in trust calibration, such as understanding user trust, assessing AI capabilities, and aligning the two.\\n*   **Bayesian Approaches:**  A few papers explore Bayesian models to represent user beliefs about AI systems and update those beliefs based on observed performance.\\n*   **Reinforcement Learning:** One paper proposes using reinforcement learning to adapt AI system behavior based on user feedback to calibrate trust dynamically.\\n*   **Comparative Studies:** Some papers compare different trust calibration methods to evaluate their effectiveness.\\n\\n**Application Areas:**\\n\\nThe papers cover a range of application areas, including:\\n\\n*   Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)\\n*   AI-assisted decision making\\n*   AI-driven healthcare\\n*   Autonomous driving systems\\n*   AI-powered education\\n*   AI-based financial systems\\n*   AI-driven customer service\\n\\n**Key Themes:**\\n\\n*   **Transparency:** Making AI systems more transparent is a common theme, with XAI being a key tool.\\n*   **User-Centric Design:**  Many papers emphasize the importance of user-centered design in trust calibration.\\n*   **Dynamic Calibration:** Some research explores dynamic methods for calibrating trust over time, using feedback and learning.\\n*   **Ethical Implications:**  Several papers discuss the ethical implications of trust calibration, highlighting the need for responsible AI design.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the research on trust calibration in AI systems is quite active and diverse, with a focus on understanding how to align user trust with the actual capabilities of AI systems through various methods and in different application areas.\\n\\n\\n', cost={'usage_including_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0.0146875, 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp': {'cost': 0.0146875, 'prompt_tokens': 11369, 'completion_tokens': 6002, 'total_tokens': 17371}}, 'usage_excluding_cached_inference': {'total_cost': 0.013079499999999999, 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp': {'cost': 0.013079499999999999, 'prompt_tokens': 10016, 'completion_tokens': 5381, 'total_tokens': 15397}}}, human_input=[])"

Many studies use human-in-the-loop experiments to measure the impact of different design choices on trust calibration.\\n\\nThis analysis should give you a good overview of how people are studying trust calibration in AI systems based on the provided arXiv search results.\\n\\nTERMINATE\\n', 'role': 'user', 'name': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'analyze the above the results to list the application domains studied by these papers ', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'user_proxy'}, {'content': 'Okay, let\\'s analyze the results again, specifically focusing on the application domains studied in the listed papers.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of the application domains mentioned in the abstracts:\\n\\n**1. General Human-AI Collaboration:**\\n\\n*   Many papers explore trust calibration in the context of general human-AI collaboration, without specifying a particular domain. These studies often use abstract tasks or scenarios to investigate fundamental principles of trust.\\n    *   Examples: \"A Diachronic Perspective on User Trust in AI under Uncertainty\", \"Overconfident and Unconfident AI Hinder Human-AI Collaboration\", \"Who Should I Trust: AI or Myself?\", \"Effect of Confidence and Explanation on Accuracy and Trust Calibration in AI-Assisted Decision Making\", \"Uncalibrated Models Can Improve Human-AI Collaboration\", \"Knowing About Knowing: An Illusion of Human Competence Can Hinder Appropriate Reliance on AI Systems\"\\n\\n**2. Robotics and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):**\\n\\n*   Several papers focus on trust calibration in the context of human-robot teams, highlighting the importance of trust for effective collaboration and safety.\\n    *   Examples: \"Trust Calibration and Trust Respect: A Method for Building Team Cohesion in Human Robot Teams\", \"Trust Considerations for Explainable Robots: A Human Factors Perspective\"\\n\\n**3. Decision Support Systems:**\\n\\n*   A significant number of papers investigate trust in AI-based decision support systems, where AI provides recommendations or advice to human decision-makers.\\n    *   Examples: \"Missing Pieces: How Framing Uncertainty Impacts Longitudinal Trust in AI Decision Aids\", \"Who Should I Trust: AI or Myself?\", \"Effect of Confidence and Explanation on Accuracy and Trust Calibration in AI-Assisted Decision Making\", \"Improving Operator Situation Awareness when Working with AI Recommender Systems\"\\n\\n**4.

Machine Translation (MT):**\\n\\n*   One paper focuses on the challenges of building appropriate trust in machine translation systems, particularly in high-stakes scenarios like healthcare.\\n    *   Example: \"Beyond General Purpose Machine Translation: The Need for Context-specific Empirical Research to Design for Appropriate User Trust\"\\n\\n**6. Large Language Models (LLMs):**\\n\\n*   One paper explores trust dynamics in the supply chains of LLMs, highlighting the complex relationships between various stakeholders and the potential for uncalibrated trust.\\n    *   Example: \"An Empirical Exploration of Trust Dynamics in LLM Supply Chains\"\\n\\n**7. Gesture Recognition:**\\n\\n*   One paper presents an interpretable rule-based system for radar-based gesture sensing, emphasizing the importance of transparency and personalization for user trust.\\n    *   Example: \"Interpretable Rule-Based System for Radar-Based Gesture Sensing: Enhancing Transparency and Personalization in AI\"\\n\\n**8. Gig Economy/Scheduling:**\\n\\n*   One paper uses the gig driving domain as a case study to investigate how the framing of uncertainty impacts trust in AI-based scheduling tools.\\n    *   Example: \"Missing Pieces: How Framing Uncertainty Impacts Longitudinal Trust in AI Decision Aids\"\\n\\n**9. AI-Assisted Teaching:**\\n\\n*   One paper explores the use of local model explanations as interfaces for machine teachers (crowd workers), and how this impacts trust calibration.\\n    *   Example: \"Towards Fair and Explainable AI using a Human-Centered AI Approach\"\\n\\n**Summary of Application Domains:**\\n\\n*   **General Human-AI Interaction:** Foundational research applicable across various AI systems.\\n*   **Robotics/HRI:** Focus on human-robot collaboration and safety.\\n*   **Decision Support:** AI systems providing recommendations to human decision-makers.\\n*   **Autonomous Vehicles:** Trust in self-driving technology.\\n*   **Machine Translation:** Trust in AI-powered language translation.\\n*   **Large Language Models:** Trust in the complex supply chains of LLMs.\\n*   **Gesture Recognition:** Trust in AI-powered gesture sensing.\\n*   **Gig Economy/Scheduling:** Trust in AI-based scheduling tools.\\n*   **AI-Assisted Teaching:** Trust in AI systems used for teaching.\\n\\nThis list provides a good overview of the diverse application domains where trust calibration in AI systems is being actively studied.
